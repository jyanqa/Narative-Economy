    "We measure the ECB's communication by two features: Topic and Tone. That is, we determine first the economic topic of the speeches. After that, we measures how they are talking about it (tone). In this paper, we make use of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to know when they are talking about economic topic and a balance measure based on dictionary methods, or word counting, to measure tone. By combining these two approaches allows us to measure topic-level tone which helps to deal, somewhat, with the weakness of dictionary methods. That is, rather than just measure words associated with expansion, we can measure expansion words associated with GDP growth rather than risk premia."

       "      <td>Public trust in the European Union (EU) and European institutions like the European Central Bank (ECB) has suffered considerable strain in recent years due to the global financial crisis, the European sovereign debt crisis and the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, In these stormy conditions, the “ship Europe” has, however, not run aground, A “Havarie Europa” is therefore not within sight, Why is public trust so critically important for central banks? Money is a credence good, Furthermore, stable money and public trust in central banks are essential to generate broad acceptance of their independence in the population at large, By contrast, a lack of public trust can render the central bank more vulnerable to political pressure, In a worst-case scenario, such a development can call into question the central bank’s independence, Hence the new measures are being questioned by parts of the public and some politicians, not least because of their suspected effects on house prices and inequality, This is all the more true as the ECB has not achieved its inflation target of below, but close to, 2 percent for several years, despite its extensive measures, Since the financial crisis, central banks therefore face new challenges relating to their communication and accountability,[3] The Eurobarometer survey offers a good basis for such an analysis, given that it provides data on trust in the currency union covering the entire period since its inception,  Descriptive analysis: trust in the ECB and the euro by socio-economic characteristics The analysis at country level provides initial indications that citizens’ perceptions of the economic situation influence their attitudes towards the monetary union,  Multivariate analyses: trust in the ECB and the euro The descriptive analysis of Eurobarometer data can only provide limited insights into the key factors that influence trust in the ECB and the euro, Multivariate analyses confirm the influence of socio-economic variables on individuals’ trust in the ECB,[12]  Based on an analysis of Eurobarometer data, Farvaque et al, The Composite Indicator of Systemic Stress (CISS) used by the ECB indicates that this policy response has averted a severe financial market crisis in the spring of 2020 (Figure 9),  Figure 9 Indicator for systemic stress in financial markets (CISS),  The ECB’s crisis measures consist mainly of a new temporary asset purchase programme, tailored specifically to the pandemic crisis – the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), The ECB’s crisis measures thus ensure the smooth transmission of our monetary policy measures to the entire euro area, Improving monetary policy communication Improvements in communication are of vital importance for public trust in the ECB, A broad-based communication strategy is essential in our efforts to improve the public’s understanding of the ECB’s mandate and tasks, We must ask ourselves how we can ensure that our communication reaches all citizens across the entire euro area, The complex structure of European decision-making processes poses particular challenges to communication efforts on the part of European institutions, In the ECB’s case, we face an additional difficulty: our decisions often concern complex economic issues, Furthermore, our communication has so far largely focused on market participants and monetary policy experts – this has done little to help the general public better understand monetary policy, The development of a more effective communication policy will therefore be a key topic in the context of our comprehensive monetary policy strategy review that we launched a few months ago,[28] It is our aim to effectively use communication in order to strengthen public trust in the ECB in a sustainable manner, In the case of the ECB, support for the euro is also a key indicator for the public’s acceptance of a common monetary policy in the European economic and monetary union, From the ECB’s perspective, we have to focus our efforts on improving communication with the public at large, Communication will therefore play an important role in the ECB’s strategy review, From this perspective, it is crucial that, during the current pandemic, the ECB has taken extensive measures to meet its price stability objective, Together with the other European institutions, the ECB will continue to do its part to keep the “ship Europe” on course, even in the stormiest of conditions, (2013), “Explaining European Union Citizens’ Trust in the European Central Bank in Normal and Crisis Times”, The Scandinavian Journal of Economics, Vol, Most of these analyses are based on the Eurobarometer survey, which is published by the European Commission, The analysis uses Eurobarometer survey data for the period 1999-2019, (2016), “Who supports the ECB? Evidence from Eurobarometer survey data”, The World Economy, Vol, (2016), “Who supports the ECB? Evidence from Eurobarometer survey data”, The World Economy , 40 (4), 654–677, (2013), “Explaining European Union citizens’ trust in the European Central Bank in normal and crisis times”, The Scandinavian Journal of Economics, Vol, (2013), “Explaining European Union citizens’ trust in the European Central Bank in normal and crisis times”, The Scandinavian Journal of Economics, Vol, Data availability for the pandemic period is currently still limited, At present, the main sources are surveys from July 2020, which were published by the European Commission in October, European Commission Standard Eurobarometer 93 (summer 2020), European Commission Standard Eurobarometer 93 (summer 2020), European Commission Standard Eurobarometer 93 (summer 2020), In response, the world has taken a giant leap forward in terms of digitalisation, The resilience of these infrastructures is of key importance to the functioning of Europe’s economy, especially during troubled times,    See the related press release and F, See the press release on the topic, as well as the full report, The euro bills and coins in our wallets, like deposits at the bank, are so-called fiat money, That is, they are not backed by an intrinsic value such as gold, According to the July 2020 Eurobarometer survey, 75 % of respondents are in favour of the European currency while 17 % are opposed to the euro, implying that net support is clearly positive,  Complementing the ECB’s crisis response and national fiscal support programmes, comprehensive measures were passed at the European level to provide financial support to governments, businesses and employees during the pandemic, 88 % are in favour of the EU drawing up an economic recovery plan to support all Member States, Public trust in the ECB has a direct impact on our monetary policy,, Anderson, C, and Persson, E,  Shortly after that meeting, the first wave of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic led to strict containment measures across Europe,  And the more Europe’s citizens rely on digital payment initiation – be it by card, credit transfer or direct debit – the more Europe’s businesses rely on the underlying financial infrastructures for the clearing and final settlement of these transactions, Europe has learned the lessons from past crises and shown that it is capable of navigating, even through turbulent waters, The trust of citizens in the ECB and public support for the euro are essential for the effectiveness of our monetary policy and the independence of the central bank, Independence protects central banks against political interference and thus underpins the credibility of monetary policy, Transparency and a clear explanation of monetary policy measures are essential for a high degree of trust, These challenges are particularly pronounced for the ECB, as it is responsible for monetary policy in the entire euro area, The consideration of individual socio-economic characteristics confirms this conjecture: survey data support the conclusion that citizens who assess the current economic outlook in Europe positively are more supportive of the monetary union (Figure 5),  A similar picture emerges when considering respondents’ personal financial situation, (2016) argue that the perception of future economic developments plays an important role: trust in the ECB grows with a more positive assessment of the economic outlook,  Figure 10 10-year yield spreads of selected government bonds over German equivalents, A similar, yet even more pronounced, decrease could be observed with regard to trust in other supranational institutions like the European Commission and the European Parliament,[25] Furthermore, 85 % of citizens agree that the necessary funds should be made available to the EU in order to better manage similar crises in the future,[27] All these elements would be important steps to make the single currency area more resilient to future crises, A better understanding of the mandate and the necessary independence of central banks also fosters trust in the ECB, Acceptance of our independence, meanwhile, is important in ensuring that the ECB can continue to fulfil its mandate in the best interest of European citizens, without being subject to political interference, Conclusions and outlook Let me conclude, Supported by strong European institutions, we have been able to withstand the turbulent waters of recent years, and Stracca, L, and Stracca, L, (2010), “From actual to perceived transparency: The case of the European Central Bank”, Journal of Economic Psychology, Vol, and Stracca, L, Another element supporting trust in the ECB is the regular presence of the ECB President at the European Parliament, And while we will certainly enjoy regaining our ability to move and interact freely, we will also learn lessons from the pandemic and see benefits from how we adapted to it, The digital transformation is here to stay, Today I will argue that this applies to the financial sector in particular and I will discuss the necessary policy response, Digitalisation and the resilience of the financial sector: lessons from the pandemic Digitalisation is transforming financial services and consumers’ behaviour[2],  DORA incorporates the lessons that have been learned from the Eurosystem’s cyber resilience strategy for financial market infrastructures, Testing cyber resilience: the TIBER-EU framework While cyber risk is a form of operational risk, it has its own unique characteristics, namely the speed and scale at which it can spread and the intent and perseverance of threat actors, Conclusion We want to avoid a situation where a cyber incident affecting financial infrastructures could evolve into a systemic financial crisis, We are all individually responsible, but we are all in it together, Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on digital operational resilience for the financial sector, 24 September 2020, A crisis-proof and economically successful Europe provides the best arguments to counter euro-scepticism, The relevance of trust for central banks This also holds true for the European Central Bank, Descriptive analysis: trust in the ECB and the euro over time Trust in the ECB – similar to trust in European institutions overall – has declined in the years following the financial crisis, It is therefore important to analyse this divergence more precisely by considering different euro area countries and groups in the population, Bergbauer et al, (2020) carry out an empirical analysis which shows that support for the euro tends to be related to respondents’ agreement regarding the general values of European cooperation, The economic consequences of the pandemic have especially affected those countries that already had relatively high debt levels prior to the crisis and where confidence in the ECB was rather low, The ECB effectively countered this risk, in particular by swiftly implementing the PEPP (Figure 10), These European crisis measures contributed significantly to reducing financial market stress, The empirical findings suggest that such a divergence at country level would weaken trust in European institutions in some parts of the euro area, It is crucial for the funds from the Next Generation EU recovery package to be used as productively as possible to sustainably increase countries’ growth potential, thereby mitigating the risk of economic divergence, Empirical analysis of the survey results indicates that trust in the ECB remains particularly low in specific population groups, This response requires a European architecture that provides suitable instruments to combat severe crises, and van Rooij, M, The following presentation builds on the article “Citizens’ attitudes towards the ECB, the euro and Economic and Monetary Union”, European Central Bank (2020), Economic Bulletin, Issue 4, Bergbauer, S, Otherwise, digitalisation may increase risks rather than reduce them,  Safeguarding the cyber resilience of financial services: building the European lines of defence To safeguard the cyber resilience of financial services, the EU can build on three lines of defence: regulation and oversight, cyber resilience testing, and intelligence sharing, DORA is therefore a welcome initiative: it provides a unique opportunity to address the current fragmentation in financial legislation and supervisory approaches in the field of digital operational resilience, including cyber resilience, We will hear more from the European Commission today on DORA, including how it contributes to the Commission’s wider digital finance package[5], Improving our cyber resilience and staying ahead of our adversaries requires ceaseless efforts from all of us, (2013) observe that there is a link between general support for EU institutions and trust in the ECB,[19]  Studies also allow for a distinction to be drawn between those factors that affect trust in the ECB and support for the euro, The severe economic crisis resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic is therefore a major challenge to citizens’ trust in the ECB, the euro and the European Union in general, Risk premia in many market segments rose sharply and funding conditions worsened markedly,  This may be due to the fact that fiscal and healthcare policy initiatives at the national level were the most visible crisis response measures for the general public, It is therefore in the ECB’s interest that European institutions can react to the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic in an efficient and coordinated manner, However, public trust in the ECB has declined markedly since the global financial crisis,, Soudan,

joint responsibility   Introductory remarks by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the fifth meeting of the Euro Cyber Resilience Board for pan-European Financial Infrastructures Frankfurt am Main, 16 December 2020 At the last meeting of the Euro Cyber Resilience Board for pan-European Financial Infrastructures (ECRB), we were all in the same room at the ECB premises in Frankfurt am Main, That was on 27 February 2020, when we launched the Cyber Information and Intelligence Sharing Initiative (CIISI-EU)[1], Working from home has become the norm for many of us, It covers – implicitly or explicitly – the Eurosystem’s cyber resilience oversight expectations, the European programme to test and improve the resilience of the financial sector against sophisticated cyber-attacks (TIBER-EU), and the Cyber Information and Intelligence Sharing Initiative created by the ECRB (CIISI-EU), The best way to demonstrate cyber resilience is to test it in a way that mimics a real-life attack, Sharing intelligence: the Cyber Information and Intelligence Sharing Initiative The objective of the ECRB is to foster trust and collaboration between pan-European financial market infrastructures and critical service providers on the one hand, and between both of these groups and the relevant authorities on the other, The ECRB also aims to encourage joint initiatives whose goal is to increase the cyber resilience capabilities of the financial sector and to reinforce its operational resilience more generally, Trust, collaboration and joint initiatives form the bedrock of the ECRB’s Cyber Information and Intelligence Sharing Initiative (CIISI-EU)[6], In February this year, we launched this initiative and committed to implementing it, The work of the ECRB is instrumental here, as it encourages trust, cooperation and joint initiatives, Cyber resilience is not a state, it is an ever-shifting aspiration, Panetta (2020), “Protecting the European financial sector: the Cyber Information and Intelligence Sharing Initiative”, Introductory remarks at the fourth meeting of the Euro Cyber Resilience Board for pan-European Financial Infrastructures,

       "      <td>Not least, it has forced us to transition to virtual modes of working, Despite the challenging circumstances, I am happy to see that so many of you have joined today’s virtual event, representing the full range of stakeholders from the private financial and non-financial sectors as well as the public sector, In the improbable event of a car accident, fastened seatbelts substantially reduce the likelihood of injury, The objectives of the two consultations will be presented and discussed over the course of this roundtable event, It is designed to meet the IOSCO principles, A few days ago, the ECB published its first annual review of the methodology used to calculate the €STR, Second, a broader use of the €STR will support the development of common standards and practices, for example in the origination of assets, Last but not least, we are grateful to our colleagues at ESMA, the European Commission and the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority for their contributions to and support for the benchmark reform process,[11]   Chart 2 – Labour productivity growth and decomposition  (period averages of annual percentage changes and percentage point contributions)   Sources: The European Commission’s AMECO database and ECB staff calculations, For example, in the euro area the share of individuals with at least basic digital skills ranges from 79% in the Netherlands to 42% in Italy,[15]  If spent wisely, NGEU funds will contribute to significantly improving technological capabilities, Recent research shows that government interventions during the 1918 influenza pandemic helped spur innovation after the pandemic ended, However, we must also recognise that digitalisation tends to reward those with higher skills and so could exacerbate inequalities, (2020), “Asymmetric risks, asymmetric reaction: monetary policy in the pandemic”, speech at the meeting of the ECB Money Market Contact Group, 22 September, (2020), “Why we all need a joint European fiscal response”, contribution published by Politico, 21 April, This development is not limited to the euro area, This year has brought unprecedented challenges on many fronts, At the height of the crisis, volumes underpinning the €STR increased, in contrast to volumes observed for longer tenors in the unsecured market segment, A high level of liquidity in the unsecured segment is concentrated in the overnight maturity, thus anchoring the €STR based on a large pool of daily transactions, The €STR is an ideal candidate for this transition,  That response has protected our economy from a potentially catastrophic depression, As a result, the euro area economy was able to stage a strong rebound over the summer, as containment measures were lifted, TLTROs are a powerful form of support to small and medium-sized enterprises, which mainly rely on bank lending,  In the past, pandemics have sparked innovation in how economies are structured, Results from the ECB’s Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE) show an increase in the number of firms considered vulnerable owing to a combination of lower profits and turnover, higher interest expenses and increasing debt-to-asset ratios, The estimates mentioned in the text refer represent the upper bound of an ideal scenario where all resources are used to fund productive investment, Given that EURIBOR remains operational, why do we even need to discuss fallback arrangements? Let me answer this question metaphorically, Fallback provisions for benchmark rates serve a similar purpose, Importantly, the €STR remains available during periods of market dislocation, This review confirms that the methodology correctly reflects the developments in the overnight unsecured money market and thus appropriately measures the underlying interest, Conclusion Resilient fallback provisions for benchmark rates are essential, How the European economy emerges from the crisis will depend on how we manage this transition, So what I would like to argue today is that policymakers must commit to continue providing certainty to the economy,  A common shock, a common response The coronavirus (COVID-19) is a common shock that has had asymmetric effects[1], hurting some sectors and economies much more than others, For monetary policy, this means providing certainty about financing conditions well into the future,[7]  The PEPP envelope can be further expanded and extended, if warranted by the inflation outlook,5% in 2023 – this means that financing conditions will need to remain very supportive even as growth accelerates from next year onwards,  Investing in Europe’s recovery But firms need certainty about more than just financing conditions, Conclusion The coronavirus shock may be a turning point for Europe, Anderton, R, As a result, EURIBOR is still used extensively in both new and legacy contracts for cash and derivatives products, We will hear more about the current regulatory and supervisory landscape from the European Commission and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) later in the session, The public consultations build on a common theme, namely the use of the ECB’s €STR in the proposed fallback measures, The market stress observed during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has underscored the relevance of this criterion, Discontinuation of EONIA: the urgent need for a rate transition However, despite the apparent qualities of the €STR, progress in adopting it has been rather slow, If the proposed fallback provisions were ever activated, the market would have to rely extensively on the €STR, In order to encourage a more widespread use of the €STR, and not just as a basis for fallback rates, the ECB is considering publishing compounded €STR average rates as well as a compounded index, Users should therefore swiftly replace EONIA and make wider use of the €STR in cash and derivatives markets, In particular, I would like to thank Mr Phutrakul, his predecessors Steven van Rijswijk and Koos Timmermans, and the entire ING team for the unwavering commitment and dedication they have demonstrated in leading the working group, But what has defined this crisis – and set it apart from previous ones – is the policy response at the European level and the recognition that a common shock requires a common response,  This was a step change in European crisis management, And – of relevance to today’s forum – this has implications for business investment, Firms will be able to take full advantage of favourable financing conditions and carry out their investment plans, High efficiency and institutional quality will be key to maximising the benefits of NGEU,[14] This requires enhancing digital skills and infrastructure, in order to be ready to face the digital challenge, It would also reduce one of the differences in structural conditions that has contributed to divergences among European economies, Reducing uncertainty is key to the effectiveness of the policy stimulus, as the responsiveness of firms to any given policy stimulus may be much weaker in periods of high uncertainty, and Van Reenen, J, (2020), “Is the Eurozone disintegrating? Macroeconomic divergence, structural polarisation, trade and fragility”, Cambridge Journal of Economics, Vol, I very much hope that the public health situation will soon allow us to meet again in person, We will provide further information on these efforts in the coming months, European policies – the ECB’s monetary policy and the joint EU fiscal support – have generated a European dividend, Eurosystem staff now project that the euro area economy will contract by more than 2% in the fourth quarter of this year, with GDP falling by 7,4% in 2023; excluding its more volatile components, it is expected to increase to only 1,  Last week, the ECB’s Governing Council did just that, Given our projections – which foresee that even in a mild scenario inflation would rise to only 1,  To lift the economy out of the crisis, governments need to wisely use the fiscal space created by our monetary policy and other key decisions at the European level – in particular joint EU borrowing,[18]  Investment to support the transition to a low-carbon economy will also be a key component of the recovery from the pandemic throughout the euro area</td>\n",

       "      <td>[3]  As part of its mission to promote the smooth operation of the payment system, the Eurosystem has two main objectives in the area of retail payments, This wide range of desirable features creates scope for innovative payment solutions, People are forced to use several instruments at the same time, This trend is likely to persist once the pandemic is over, Cash offers a secure and inclusive way of making in-person payments, but it is not well suited for payments in a digital context, such as in e-commerce, Numerous banks are expanding their range of digital services by entering into agreements with fintechs; in some cases, integration is achieved when a bank acquires a fintech firm,  If not properly regulated, big techs may pose considerable risks from an economic and social perspective and they may restrict, rather than expand, consumer choice, As a result, stablecoin users are likely to bear higher credit, market and liquidity risks, and the stablecoins themselves are vulnerable to runs[15], with potentially systemic implications[16], Yesterday the Euro Retail Payments Board, chaired by the ECB, launched a work stream to facilitate this access, A digital euro would support the modernisation of the financial sector and the broader economy, And in making it easier for intermediaries to provide added value and advanced technological features at lower cost, it would give rise to products that could compete with those of the big techs, thereby benefitting end users, This requires central bank money to remain available under all circumstances – in the form of cash, of course, but also potentially as a digital euro, A recent survey identified over 200 new payment solutions, of which more than one-third were provided by start-ups, For a detailed analysis of these solutions, see ECB (2019), “Implications of digitalisation in retail payments for the Eurosystem’s catalyst role”, July, Stablecoins are digital units of value designed to minimise fluctuations in their price against a reference currency or basket of currencies, See Bindseil, U, Alternatively, limits on individual holdings could be achieved by imposing direct quantitative constraints,[1] The universe of retail transactions[2] amounted to 213 billion payments – two million every five minutes – with an estimated total value of €164 trillion, The second is to ensure that transactions remain safe, underpinning confidence in our currency and the functioning of our economy, Currently, none of the existing solutions – cash, cards, credit transfers, direct debits and e-money – meet all the required features at once, In-person transactions[4] are mostly conducted with cash and cards,[5] Remote purchases are dominated by cards and e-payments,[6] And bills are generally paid using direct debits and credit transfers,[7]  The coronavirus (COVID-19) shock has accelerated the trend towards digitalisation, leading to a surge in online transactions and contactless payments in shops,[9] Payment cards, on the other hand, facilitate digital, contactless payments, And the Europe-wide acceptance of cards issued under national card schemes currently relies on agreements with international card schemes, As a result, people mostly use international schemes for cross-border card payments, and the European market for card payments is dominated by non-European schemes, Generally, Europe is increasingly relying on foreign providers, with a high degree of market concentration in some segments, such as card transactions and online payments,  The influx of technology firms Fintech companies have sparked the latest wave of innovation, accelerating the evolution of the payment system, The global tech giants – the so-called big techs – are aiming for a revolution in the payments landscape, and represent a threat to traditional intermediation, They can use these advantages, their financial strength and their global footprint to provide new payment solutions and expand in both domestic and cross-border transactions,  The big techs may also contribute to a rapid take-up, both domestically and across borders, of so-called stablecoins,[21]  We are supporting access to bank accounts by non-bank providers, so that they can expand the range of payment initiation services they offer, We have created a solid basis for instant payments, with commonly agreed rules and powerful infrastructures, including the TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) service, operated by the Eurosystem, Thanks to the measures we have taken in recent months, all euro instant payment providers and infrastructures will have access to TIPS by the end of 2021, It would be designed to be interoperable with private payment solutions and would thus represent the “raw material” that supervised intermediaries could use to offer pan-European, front-end payment solutions, First, we will test the compatibility between a digital euro and existing central bank settlement services (such as TIPS), In particular, big techs and stablecoins could disrupt the European financial system,    The data refer to European citizens aged 18 or over and include point-of-sale, person-to-person and remote transactions, as well as bill payments, Whether they are made at the physical point of sale or online and whether they are made by private individuals, businesses or the public sector, Payments at the physical point of sale and person-to-person payments, As of 2019, cash is used by euro area adults for 73% of in-person transactions in terms of volume and 48% in terms of value, Card payments account for most of the remainder: 24% in terms of volume and 41% in terms of value, Card payments account for approximately half of all remote purchases, and e-payments for approximately one-quarter, in terms of both volume and value, Direct debits account for 41% of bill payments in terms of volume and 37% in terms of value, Credit transfers account for 20% of bill payments in terms of volume and 29% in terms of value, In terms of the total volume of in-person transactions by euro area adults, cash declined from 79% in 2016 to 73% in 2019, In terms of the value of in-person transactions, it fell from 54% to 48%, VISA and Mastercard intermediate two-thirds of EU card payments and, along with PayPal, dominate online payments, Global stablecoins are initiatives which aim to achieve a global footprint, without necessarily relying on existing payment schemes and clearing and settlement arrangements, (2019), “In search for stability in crypto-assets: are stablecoins the solution?”, Occasional Paper Series, No 230, ECB, August, Up to now, oversight activity has been focused on traditional electronic payment solutions such as payment cards, direct debits, credit transfers and e-money, These include payment initiation services, payment integrators, wallets storing data and tokenised payment account numbers, The experimentation will examine the scalability of TIPS (i, The digital transformation is raising the bar for convenience and safety,[10]  We should not let this reliance turn into dependence, It could reduce the resilience of the payment system and weaken the ability of European authorities to exercise controls,[11] Many of them have adopted data-driven business models, where payment services are provided free of charge in exchange for personal data, This would offer them an even stronger base to further expand the range of their financial activities, including lending, as their superior ability to collect and analyse large volumes of data gives them an information advantage,[13] As I have argued previously[14], stablecoins raise concerns with regard to consumer protection and financial stability, Our policy is based on interconnected elements addressing the entire payment value chain,  First, we have enhanced our retail payments strategy, in order to foster competitive and innovative payments with a strong European presence, We are working to make the European e-identity and e-signature frameworks better suited for payments and the financial sector more broadly, And today we are launching a public consultation on the new regulation, which will then become operational by mid-2021,  We are also completing the public consultation on our new framework for electronic payment instruments, schemes and arrangements, the so-called PISA framework, As part of our comprehensive policy, we are working to safeguard the role of sovereign money in the digital era: we want to be ready to introduce a digital euro, if needed, Together, these two types of money would be available to all, offering greater choice and access to simple, costless ways of paying,  A digital euro would need to be carefully designed, in order to enhance privacy in digital payments[26], respect the rules on countering illegal activities and avoid interference with central bank policies, first and foremost monetary policy and financial stability,  Conclusion Let me conclude, The digital transformation is triggering a revolution in the financial sector, which will bring innovation but also risks, We want to create the conditions for a resilient, innovative, diverse and competitive payments landscape that can better serve the evolving needs of European people and businesses, We want to enable people to choose their preferred way of paying without having to compromise on their expectations of fast, secure, inclusive and seamless payments, and Stracca, L, The European Commission’s legislative proposal on crypto-assets (MiCA) is an important step in this regard, Convenience requires payments to be easy to use, fast and widely accepted, while safety requires low risk from an economic, financial and societal perspective, We must ensure that the payment market remains open to competition, including from European suppliers and technology, It could endanger monetary sovereignty if, as a result, private money – the stablecoin – were to largely displace sovereign money as a means of payment,  Monetary sovereignty could also be threatened if foreign central bank digital currencies became widely used in the euro area, with implications for international monetary spillovers, We must nonetheless be alert to possible non-linear developments that could endanger financial stability and monetary and economic sovereignty, As we aim to enhance the efficiency of European payments, we therefore need to be prepared to rethink the nature and the role of sovereign money, The Eurosystem policy response The Eurosystem is implementing a comprehensive policy to ensure that citizens’ payment needs are met, while safeguarding the integrity of the payment system and financial stability,  Our retail payments strategy also builds on the promotion of instant payments, which make funds immediately available to recipients,  Second, we are adapting our regulatory and oversight framework to the fast pace of financial and technological innovation, PISA extends our oversight[23] to digital payment tokens[24], including stablecoins, and to payment arrangements providing functionalities to end users of electronic payment instruments[25], A digital euro would combine the efficiency of a digital payment instrument with the safety of central bank money, To this end, some stablecoin initiatives pledge to hold a reserve of State-issued currencies or other assets against which stablecoin holdings can be redeemed or exchanged, The ECB has already started work on privacy-enhancing techniques in cooperation with the Bank of Japan, The first is to guarantee that people have access to efficient payment solutions that meet their preferences, They can aggravate the risk of personal information being misused for commercial or other purposes, jeopardising privacy and competition, We are actively promoting pan-European initiatives that offer secure, cheap and widely accepted payment solutions,  In particular, a digital euro should be a means of payment, not a form of investment that competes with other financial instruments, And fourth, we will assess the functionalities of hardware devices that could enable offline transactions, guaranteeing privacy, And while they could offer convenient and efficient payment solutions, they also risk endangering competition, privacy, financial stability and even monetary sovereignty, We are promoting safe, pan-European instant payments, In the current situation the viability of such a business model is however challenged by the fact that short term rates are negative, In contrast, the substitutability between central bank money and bank deposits is limited by the fact that, on bank balance sheets, deposits are matched against risky assets (bank loans)</td>\n",

       "      <td>In terms of our monetary policy measures, the combination of the already-low levels of our main policy rates and our previously-installed forward guidance on the future path of interest rates (which links the path of our policy rates to the robust convergence of inflation to our aim) has acted as an automatic stabiliser through the adjustment of policy rate expectations – and hence the entire spectrum of monetary conditions – to pandemic-related changes in the inflation outlook,    The cost of monetary policy inaction In assessing the contribution of monetary policy to countering the pandemic shock, a natural benchmark is to calculate the adverse impact that would have materialised had monetary policy not been responsive,3 percentage points lower and the annual inflation rate would be 0, A more realistic assumption for constructing counterfactual financial conditions is to recognise that, in the event of policy inaction, financial markets – which were already highly destabilised – would have gone into a tailspin, sending the economy into a meltdown, However, building on recent advances in the macro-econometrics of estimating the impact of financial tail risks, preliminary results by ECB staff indicate that the ECB’s removal of the financial tail risk associated with the pandemic ensured a degree of support to growth that is several times larger than the impact derived by the more limited calculation shown in Chart 3,[10]   Chart 4 Impact on output of a tightening of credit conditions under different states of the economy  (year-on-year percentage changes)   Source: ECB calculations,[11]   Chart 5 Sectoral decomposition of GDP  (quarter-on-quarter percentage change, percentage point contributions)   Sources: Eurostat and ECB staff calculation,     Chart 13 The quick ratio of firms  (median)   Sources: Standard &amp; Poor’s and ECB staff calculations,     Chart 14 Leverage ratio of firms  (percent, median)   Sources: Standard &amp; Poor’s and ECB staff calculations, In particular, fiscal transfers in normal times are associated with only-limited effects on output, but these constitute a powerful instrument when granted to liquidity-constrained households or struggling firms in the current environment, A tightening in funding costs or worsening liquidity positions have so far been forestalled by the prompt policy reaction, and banks, in turn, have been able and willing to meet the strong demand for liquidity over the course of the pandemic, The October euro area bank lending survey (BLS) reports a broad-based tightening of credit standards that banks attribute primarily to the risks underlying the macroeconomic environment and a deterioration in borrower creditworthiness (Chart 15), The net percentages for the “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in credit standards, currently mainly related to the policy interventions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, The latest observation is for the third quarter of 2020 for actual credit standards and the fourth quarter of 2020 for expected credit standards, Furthermore, this adverse interaction would be reinforced if household spending were to weaken and thereby were to further dampen firm prospects, In this context, it is essential that inflation expectations are anchored by the commitment of the central bank to offset the negative pandemic shock to the inflation path and ensure convergence to the inflation aim over the medium term, In this context, our in-progress strategy review will help to shape the future course of our monetary policy, (2020), “The ECB’s monetary policy in the pandemic: meeting the challenge”, speech at the 62 NABE Annual Meeting, 6 October, (2020), “The ECB’s monetary policy in the pandemic: meeting the challenge”, speech at the 62 NABE Annual Meeting, 6 October See also de Guindos, L, The paper shows how the sharp increase in financing conditions at the outset of the pandemic were assuaged by a QE programme that eased balance sheet constraints on financial intermediaries, which in turn improved overall financial conditions, The study also shows that these crisis policy interventions may have longer lasting effects on the economy, (2019), “Vulnerable growth”, American Economic Review, Vol 109 (4), pp, (2020), “The ECB’s monetary policy in the pandemic: meeting the challenge”, speech at the 62 NABE Annual Meeting, 6 October and Lagarde, C, (2020), “The ECB’s monetary policy in the pandemic: meeting the challenge”, speech at the 62 NABE Annual Meeting, 6 October, Shaded areas report take-up of banks that change their expected use of funds between survey waves, However, the results of the ECB’s pilot Consumer Expectations Survey (CES) confirm that these households are receiving a higher share of pandemic-related government support,[14] This points to the risk that cumulated leverage might weigh on business investment during the post-pandemic recovery phase, However, there are some worrying signals in recent survey data, In one direction, banks may view the dwindling loan demand as a negative signal about the state of the economy,  Third, since it is clear that considerable fiscal support (at both EU and national levels) remains necessary for as long as the pandemic limits the normal operation of the economy and in order to underpin the post-pandemic recovery phase, monetary policy must act both to facilitate the necessarily-expansive fiscal stance and to minimise the crowding-out of private sector activity that would occur if high levels of public borrowing were transmitted to an increase in sovereign yields, Second, it would contribute to a downward drift in inflation expectations that might become entrenched, By setting the monetary stance at the appropriate level to deliver the financial conditions required to offset the pandemic shock to inflation, the underlying inflation trajectory will be restored, This will remain an essential priority even in the post-pandemic phase, given that the macroeconomic hit from the pandemic is likely to persist even after medical solutions have been rolled out, (2020), “Consumption Dynamics in the COVID Crisis: Real Time Insights from French Transaction &amp; Bank Data”, Focus, No 049-2020, Conseil d’analyse économique, p, As shown in Chart 2, these operations have substantially supported the granting of loans to the non-financial private sector, have been effective in easing terms and conditions on bank lending and have helped keep lending rates near historic lows, The blue bar measures the same take-up by banks that intend to use the funds for granting loans, The yellow bar reflects take-up by banks that intend to use the funds for purposes other than substituting market funding or granting loans (government securities, holding as cash, financing other financial entities, and others), The green bar reports the take-up by banks that plan to allocate the funds to more than one purpose,8 percentage points lower by 2022 in cumulative terms (Chart 3), In the type of macroeconomic models that central banks typically use for simulation and policy analysis, it is challenging to reflect the role of monetary policy measures in providing a credible backstop against adverse tail risks – such as an arrest in the flow of credit to the economy and acute financial instability, Chart 6 shows that the impact of the pandemic also varies across countries, in line with differences in the relative importance of the services sector and available policy space,Notes: “Actual” values are changes that have occurred, while “expected” values are changes anticipated by banks,Notes: “Actual” values are changes that have occurred, while “expected” values are changes anticipated by banks, Another type of adverse real-financial feedback loop under pandemic conditions consists of the self-reinforcing nature of a sub-optimal fiscal-financial interaction process by which fiscal policy insufficiently responds to the pandemic shock in fear of triggering an unwarranted tightening of funding conditions, Conclusion The pandemic constitutes a multi-phase challenge for monetary policy, Only by ensuring appropriately-favourable financial conditions will the full economic recovery be assured and, by countering the negative impact of the pandemic on the projected inflation path, will robust convergence to our medium-term inflation aim be copperfastened, This approach reflects the uncertainty about the most appropriate model representation of the monetary transmission, which is particularly acute when the monetary impulse is imparted through unconventional tools such as asset purchase programmes, In the model set-up, these are shown to prevent a fall in the stock of productive capital, An illustrative counterfactual exercise by ECB staff suggests that the TLTRO support in removing tail risk would be in the order of three percentage points of euro area real GDP growth in cumulative terms over 2020-22, Since additional monetary policy measures were clearly necessary to meet the scale and special nature of the pandemic shock, we introduced a comprehensive package of complementary measures that acted along two main dimensions: (i) asset purchases; and (ii) liquidity operations, It follows that this first approach to quantifying the effects of our policies is likely to underestimate by a wide margin their true effect under the macro-financial conditions generated by the extraordinary pandemic shock,    In relation to business investment, firms are likely to postpone or cancel some of their capital expenditure plans against a background of heightened uncertainty about future demand for their products, spare capacity and weakened balance sheets (Chart 12),Note: The latest observation is for the third quarter of 2020    Fiscal policy is in the best position to differentiate and channel economic support to where it is needed most, “Cost of funds and balance sheet constraints” is the unweighted average of “costs related to capital position”, “access to market financing” and “liquidity position”; “risk perceptions” is the unweighted average of “general economic situation and outlook”, “industry or firm-specific situation and outlook/borrower’s creditworthiness” and “risk related to the collateral demanded”; “competition” is the unweighted average of “competition from other banks”, “competition from non-banks” and “competition from market financing”, The net percentages for responses to questions relating to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to increasing demand and the percentage reporting that it contributed to decreasing demand, Adopting such a broad-based modelling approach increases the robustness of the estimates, (2020), “Gauging the Effects of the German COVID-19 Fiscal Stimulus Package”, mimeo; and Pfeiffer, P, These flagship initiatives were accompanied by a suite of supporting measures, including the easing of the collateral framework along various dimensions,, Motto, R, and Yiangou, J,     Chart 10 Private consumption and consumer confidence in the euro area  (year-on-year percentage change, percentage balance)   Sources: European Commission Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs, Eurostat and ECB,     Chart 11 Household savings, deposits, loans and currency in circulation  (change since end-2019, percentage points of disposable income)   Sources: European Commission Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs, Eurostat and ECB,Notes: Change since December 2019 for deposits, loans, and currency in circulation and since the fourth quarter of 2019 for the savings rate, The latest observation is for October 2020 for deposits, loans and currency in circulation and the second quarter of 2020 for the saving rate,  Chart 12 Industrial confidence and investment in machinery and equipment  (quarter-on-quarter percentage change;

       "      <td>Inequality is rising, both within and across countries, Predicting the direction and scope of these shifts for monetary policy is inherently difficult, At the ECB, we are doing this as part of our ongoing monetary policy strategy review, But the pandemic is only the latest in a series of adverse disinflationary shocks that have hit advanced economies in recent years,[3] A longer life expectancy can induce people to save more to smooth consumption over a longer period of time, This is all the more important in a currency union as large and diverse as the euro area, where too low area-wide inflation carries substantial risks that parts of the currency area potentially face long periods of falling prices,   Slide 5 Monetary policy most effective in stressed conditions, deposit rates often floored at 0%     But empirical evidence also suggests that the marginal effects of financial conditions on output and inflation become less clear when the economy is recovering or expanding, In the years after the global financial and euro area sovereign debt crises, there has been a broad debate about the appropriate policy response to lift the euro area economy out of its low-growth, low-inflation trap, Empirical evidence suggests that such indicators can often provide only little additional forward-looking information about inflation, even for a horizon of only one to two years ahead,[19] For example, in surveys a significant fraction of consumers report very high inflation expectations – often in excess of 10%, But a limited understanding of actual levels does not necessarily stop people from acting on their beliefs, They would face two pertinent challenges, however, The first is that monetary policy faces constraints, But these instruments will ultimately also face constraints, The wide-ranging nature of the instruments we use today raises the bar of accountability, But side effects are a difficult topic for central banks, no less than for medical practitioners, These concerns raise the question as to whether monetary policy should take financial stability considerations more systematically into account and, if so, how this should be done,  One aspect in this context is the optimal interaction between monetary and prudential policies, (2017), “Conventional Monetary Policy Transmission During Financial Crises: An Empirical Analysis”, Journal of Applied Econometrics, Vol, (2017), “Measuring the natural rate of interest: International trends and determinants”, Journal of International Economics, Vol, (2020), “Communication and the Beliefs of Economic Agents”, NBER Working Papers, No 27800, National Bureau of Economic Research, (2017), “Is monetary policy less effective when interest rates are persistently low?”, BIS Working Papers, No 628, Bank for International Settlements, April,[1] And global value chains are being re-examined, Central banks may have to change how they pursue their mandates in the face of evolving consumer preferences and changing technologies, COVID-19 and risks to price stability Let me explain each of these challenges in turn, starting with the meaning of price stability in times of low inflation, But if prices fall or stagnate for the wrong reasons, as is the case today, then they are typically the harbinger of lower future growth and employment,  The same forces that are weighing on inflation have also contributed to the decline in the real natural rate of interest – the rate that balances savings and investment without exerting pressure on prices (see right chart slide 3),[4] By stabilising market conditions at a time of exceptional uncertainty and demand for safety, the PEPP acted as an important circuit breaker that stopped the pandemic from turning into a full-blown financial crisis (see slide 4),  Heightened uncertainty, in turn, is likely to weaken the willingness and ability of firms and households to take full advantage of historically loose financial conditions, Evidence is too scant to draw definitive conclusions at this stage,  This is why many central bank scholars have been concerned about the gradual fall in market-based inflation expectations in recent years, First, a large part of the fall in market-based inflation expectations can be explained by a fall in the inflation risk premium (see left chart slide 7),  Once one corrects for the fall in the risk premium, developments in market-based and survey-based measures of inflation expectations are much more aligned (see right chart slide 7),   Slide 7 Declining risk premium accounting for large share of fall in inflation expectations     Second, it is not clear how representative option prices in financial markets are for the broader economy,[18]  By now, we have a relatively clear understanding that most households and firms cannot point with any certainty to the actual level of inflation or interest rates, And, second, if people associate higher inflation with worse personal economic outcomes, then we should become better in explaining to the public what it is that we do and why current low inflation may be harmful to growth and employment, But it is much harder to explain why inflation of 2% is better than 1%, But what we learn from our analysis of how monetary policy transmission to the real economy may change in a low interest rate environment

       "0     Public trust in the European Union (EU) and European institutions like the European Central Bank (ECB) has suffered considerable strain in recent years due to the global financial crisis, the European sovereign debt crisis and the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, In these stormy conditions, the “ship Europe” has, however, not run aground, A “Havarie Europa” is therefore not within sight, Why is public trust so critically important for central banks? Money is a credence good, Furthermore, stable money and public trust in central banks are essential to generate broad acceptance of their independence in the population at large, By contrast, a lack of public trust can render the central bank more vulnerable to political pressure, In a worst-case scenario, such a development can call into question the central bank’s independence, Hence the new measures are being questioned by parts of the public and some politicians, not least because of their suspected effects on house prices and inequality, This is all the more true as the ECB has not achieved its inflation target of below, but close to, 2 percent for several years, despite its extensive measures, Since the financial crisis, central banks therefore face new challenges relating to their communication and accountability,[3] The Eurobarometer survey offers a good basis for such an analysis, given that it provides data on trust in the currency union covering the entire period since its inception,  Descriptive analysis: trust in the ECB and the euro by socio-economic characteristics The analysis at country level provides initial indications that citizens’ perceptions of the economic situation influence their attitudes towards the monetary union,  Multivariate analyses: trust in the ECB and the euro The descriptive analysis of Eurobarometer data can only provide limited insights into the key factors that influence trust in the ECB and the euro, Multivariate analyses confirm the influence of socio-economic variables on individuals’ trust in the ECB,[12]  Based on an analysis of Eurobarometer data, Farvaque et al, The Composite Indicator of Systemic Stress (CISS) used by the ECB indicates that this policy response has averted a severe financial market crisis in the spring of 2020 (Figure 9),  Figure 9 Indicator for systemic stress in financial markets (CISS),  The ECB’s crisis measures consist mainly of a new temporary asset purchase programme, tailored specifically to the pandemic crisis – the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), The ECB’s crisis measures thus ensure the smooth transmission of our monetary policy measures to the entire euro area, Improving monetary policy communication Improvements in communication are of vital importance for public trust in the ECB, A broad-based communication strategy is essential in our efforts to improve the public’s understanding of the ECB’s mandate and tasks, We must ask ourselves how we can ensure that our communication reaches all citizens across the entire euro area, The complex structure of European decision-making processes poses particular challenges to communication efforts on the part of European institutions, In the ECB’s case, we face an additional difficulty: our decisions often concern complex economic issues, Furthermore, our communication has so far largely focused on market participants and monetary policy experts – this has done little to help the general public better understand monetary policy, The development of a more effective communication policy will therefore be a key topic in the context of our comprehensive monetary policy strategy review that we launched a few months ago,[28] It is our aim to effectively use communication in order to strengthen public trust in the ECB in a sustainable manner, In the case of the ECB, support for the euro is also a key indicator for the public’s acceptance of a common monetary policy in the European economic and monetary union, From the ECB’s perspective, we have to focus our efforts on improving communication with the public at large, Communication will therefore play an important role in the ECB’s strategy review, From this perspective, it is crucial that, during the current pandemic, the ECB has taken extensive measures to meet its price stability objective, Together with the other European institutions, the ECB will continue to do its part to keep the “ship Europe” on course, even in the stormiest of conditions, (2013), “Explaining European Union Citizens’ Trust in the European Central Bank in Normal and Crisis Times”, The Scandinavian Journal of Economics, Vol, Most of these analyses are based on the Eurobarometer survey, which is published by the European Commission, The analysis uses Eurobarometer survey data for the period 1999-2019, (2016), “Who supports the ECB? Evidence from Eurobarometer survey data”, The World Economy, Vol, (2016), “Who supports the ECB? Evidence from Eurobarometer survey data”, The World Economy , 40 (4), 654–677, (2013), “Explaining European Union citizens’ trust in the European Central Bank in normal and crisis times”, The Scandinavian Journal of Economics, Vol, (2013), “Explaining European Union citizens’ trust in the European Central Bank in normal and crisis times”, The Scandinavian Journal of Economics, Vol, Data availability for the pandemic period is currently still limited, At present, the main sources are surveys from July 2020, which were published by the European Commission in October, European Commission Standard Eurobarometer 93 (summer 2020), European Commission Standard Eurobarometer 93 (summer 2020), European Commission Standard Eurobarometer 93 (summer 2020), In response, the world has taken a giant leap forward in terms of digitalisation, The resilience of these infrastructures is of key importance to the functioning of Europe’s economy, especially during troubled times,    See the related press release and F, See the press release on the topic, as well as the full report, The euro bills and coins in our wallets, like deposits at the bank, are so-called fiat money, That is, they are not backed by an intrinsic value such as gold, According to the July 2020 Eurobarometer survey, 75 % of respondents are in favour of the European currency while 17 % are opposed to the euro, implying that net support is clearly positive,  Complementing the ECB’s crisis response and national fiscal support programmes, comprehensive measures were passed at the European level to provide financial support to governments, businesses and employees during the pandemic, 88 % are in favour of the EU drawing up an economic recovery plan to support all Member States, Public trust in the ECB has a direct impact on our monetary policy,, Anderson, C, and Persson, E,  Shortly after that meeting, the first wave of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic led to strict containment measures across Europe,  And the more Europe’s citizens rely on digital payment initiation – be it by card, credit transfer or direct debit – the more Europe’s businesses rely on the underlying financial infrastructures for the clearing and final settlement of these transactions, Europe has learned the lessons from past crises and shown that it is capable of navigating, even through turbulent waters, The trust of citizens in the ECB and public support for the euro are essential for the effectiveness of our monetary policy and the independence of the central bank, Independence protects central banks against political interference and thus underpins the credibility of monetary policy, Transparency and a clear explanation of monetary policy measures are essential for a high degree of trust, These challenges are particularly pronounced for the ECB, as it is responsible for monetary policy in the entire euro area, The consideration of individual socio-economic characteristics confirms this conjecture: survey data support the conclusion that citizens who assess the current economic outlook in Europe positively are more supportive of the monetary union (Figure 5),  A similar picture emerges when considering respondents’ personal financial situation, (2016) argue that the perception of future economic developments plays an important role: trust in the ECB grows with a more positive assessment of the economic outlook,  Figure 10 10-year yield spreads of selected government bonds over German equivalents, A similar, yet even more pronounced, decrease could be observed with regard to trust in other supranational institutions like the European Commission and the European Parliament,[25] Furthermore, 85 % of citizens agree that the necessary funds should be made available to the EU in order to better manage similar crises in the future,[27] All these elements would be important steps to make the single currency area more resilient to future crises, A better understanding of the mandate and the necessary independence of central banks also fosters trust in the ECB, Acceptance of our independence, meanwhile, is important in ensuring that the ECB can continue to fulfil its mandate in the best interest of European citizens, without being subject to political interference, Conclusions and outlook Let me conclude, Supported by strong European institutions, we have been able to withstand the turbulent waters of recent years, and Stracca, L, and Stracca, L, (2010), “From actual to perceived transparency: The case of the European Central Bank”, Journal of Economic Psychology, Vol, and Stracca, L, Another element supporting trust in the ECB is the regular presence of the ECB President at the European Parliament, And while we will certainly enjoy regaining our ability to move and interact freely, we will also learn lessons from the pandemic and see benefits from how we adapted to it, The digital transformation is here to stay, Today I will argue that this applies to the financial sector in particular and I will discuss the necessary policy response, Digitalisation and the resilience of the financial sector: lessons from the pandemic Digitalisation is transforming financial services and consumers’ behaviour[2],  DORA incorporates the lessons that have been learned from the Eurosystem’s cyber resilience strategy for financial market infrastructures, Testing cyber resilience: the TIBER-EU framework While cyber risk is a form of operational risk, it has its own unique characteristics, namely the speed and scale at which it can spread and the intent and perseverance of threat actors, Conclusion We want to avoid a situation where a cyber incident affecting financial infrastructures could evolve into a systemic financial crisis, We are all individually responsible, but we are all in it together, Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on digital operational resilience for the financial sector, 24 September 2020, A crisis-proof and economically successful Europe provides the best arguments to counter euro-scepticism, The relevance of trust for central banks This also holds true for the European Central Bank, Descriptive analysis: trust in the ECB and the euro over time Trust in the ECB – similar to trust in European institutions overall – has declined in the years following the financial crisis, It is therefore important to analyse this divergence more precisely by considering different euro area countries and groups in the population, Bergbauer et al, (2020) carry out an empirical analysis which shows that support for the euro tends to be related to respondents’ agreement regarding the general values of European cooperation, The economic consequences of the pandemic have especially affected those countries that already had relatively high debt levels prior to the crisis and where confidence in the ECB was rather low, The ECB effectively countered this risk, in particular by swiftly implementing the PEPP (Figure 10), These European crisis measures contributed significantly to reducing financial market stress, The empirical findings suggest that such a divergence at country level would weaken trust in European institutions in some parts of the euro area, It is crucial for the funds from the Next Generation EU recovery package to be used as productively as possible to sustainably increase countries’ growth potential, thereby mitigating the risk of economic divergence, Empirical analysis of the survey results indicates that trust in the ECB remains particularly low in specific population groups, This response requires a European architecture that provides suitable instruments to combat severe crises, and van Rooij, M, The following presentation builds on the article “Citizens’ attitudes towards the ECB, the euro and Economic and Monetary Union”, European Central Bank (2020), Economic Bulletin, Issue 4, Bergbauer, S, Otherwise, digitalisation may increase risks rather than reduce them,  Safeguarding the cyber resilience of financial services: building the European lines of defence To safeguard the cyber resilience of financial services, the EU can build on three lines of defence: regulation and oversight, cyber resilience testing, and intelligence sharing, DORA is therefore a welcome initiative: it provides a unique opportunity to address the current fragmentation in financial legislation and supervisory approaches in the field of digital operational resilience, including cyber resilience, We will hear more from the European Commission today on DORA, including how it contributes to the Commission’s wider digital finance package[5], Improving our cyber resilience and staying ahead of our adversaries requires ceaseless efforts from all of us, (2013) observe that there is a link between general support for EU institutions and trust in the ECB,[19]  Studies also allow for a distinction to be drawn between those factors that affect trust in the ECB and support for the euro, The severe economic crisis resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic is therefore a major challenge to citizens’ trust in the ECB, the euro and the European Union in general, Risk premia in many market segments rose sharply and funding conditions worsened markedly,  This may be due to the fact that fiscal and healthcare policy initiatives at the national level were the most visible crisis response measures for the general public, It is therefore in the ECB’s interest that European institutions can react to the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic in an efficient and coordinated manner, However, public trust in the ECB has declined markedly since the global financial crisis,, Soudan,

joint responsibility   Introductory remarks by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the fifth meeting of the Euro Cyber Resilience Board for pan-European Financial Infrastructures Frankfurt am Main, 16 December 2020 At the last meeting of the Euro Cyber Resilience Board for pan-European Financial Infrastructures (ECRB), we were all in the same room at the ECB premises in Frankfurt am Main, That was on 27 February 2020, when we launched the Cyber Information and Intelligence Sharing Initiative (CIISI-EU)[1], Working from home has become the norm for many of us, It covers – implicitly or explicitly – the Eurosystem’s cyber resilience oversight expectations, the European programme to test and improve the resilience of the financial sector against sophisticated cyber-attacks (TIBER-EU), and the Cyber Information and Intelligence Sharing Initiative created by the ECRB (CIISI-EU), The best way to demonstrate cyber resilience is to test it in a way that mimics a real-life attack, Sharing intelligence: the Cyber Information and Intelligence Sharing Initiative The objective of the ECRB is to foster trust and collaboration between pan-European financial market infrastructures and critical service providers on the one hand, and between both of these groups and the relevant authorities on the other, The ECRB also aims to encourage joint initiatives whose goal is to increase the cyber resilience capabilities of the financial sector and to reinforce its operational resilience more generally, Trust, collaboration and joint initiatives form the bedrock of the ECRB’s Cyber Information and Intelligence Sharing Initiative (CIISI-EU)[6], In February this year, we launched this initiative and committed to implementing it, The work of the ECRB is instrumental here, as it encourages trust, cooperation and joint initiatives, Cyber resilience is not a state, it is an ever-shifting aspiration, Panetta (2020), “Protecting the European financial sector: the Cyber Information and Intelligence Sharing Initiative”, Introductory remarks at the fourth meeting of the Euro Cyber Resilience Board for pan-European Financial Infrastructures,

transition to virtual modes of working, Despite the challenging circumstances, I am happy to see that so many of you have joined today’s virtual event, representing the full range of stakeholders from the private financial and non-financial sectors as well as the public sector, In the improbable event of a car accident, fastened seatbelts substantially reduce the likelihood of injury, The objectives of the two consultations will be presented and discussed over the course of this roundtable event, It is designed to meet the IOSCO principles, A few days ago, the ECB published its first annual review of the methodology used to calculate the €STR, Second, a broader use of the €STR will support the development of common standards and practices, for example in the origination of assets, Last but not least, we are grateful to our colleagues at ESMA, the European Commission and the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority for their contributions to and support for the benchmark reform process,[11]   Chart 2 – Labour productivity growth and decomposition  (period averages of annual percentage changes and percentage point contributions)   Sources: The European Commission’s AMECO database and ECB staff calculations, For example, in the euro area the share of individuals with at least basic digital skills ranges from 79% in the Netherlands to 42% in Italy,[15]  If spent wisely, NGEU funds will contribute to significantly improving technological capabilities, Recent research shows that government interventions during the 1918 influenza pandemic helped spur innovation after the pandemic ended, However, we must also recognise that digitalisation tends to reward those with higher skills and so could exacerbate inequalities, (2020), “Asymmetric risks, asymmetric reaction: monetary policy in the pandemic”, speech at the meeting of the ECB Money Market Contact Group, 22 September, (2020), “Why we all need a joint European fiscal response”, contribution published by Politico, 21 April, This development is not limited to the euro area, This year has brought unprecedented challenges on many fronts, At the height of the crisis, volumes underpinning the €STR increased, in contrast to volumes observed for longer tenors in the unsecured market segment, A high level of liquidity in the unsecured segment is concentrated in the overnight maturity, thus anchoring the €STR based on a large pool of daily transactions, The €STR is an ideal candidate for this transition,  That response has protected our economy from a potentially catastrophic depression, As a result, the euro area economy was able to stage a strong rebound over the summer, as containment measures were lifted, TLTROs are a powerful form of support to small and medium-sized enterprises, which mainly rely on bank lending,  In the past, pandemics have sparked innovation in how economies are structured, Results from the ECB’s Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE) show an increase in the number of firms considered vulnerable owing to a combination of lower profits and turnover, higher interest expenses and increasing debt-to-asset ratios, The estimates mentioned in the text refer represent the upper bound of an ideal scenario where all resources are used to fund productive investment, Given that EURIBOR remains operational, why do we even need to discuss fallback arrangements? Let me answer this question metaphorically, Fallback provisions for benchmark rates serve a similar purpose, Importantly, the €STR remains available during periods of market dislocation, This review confirms that the methodology correctly reflects the developments in the overnight unsecured money market and thus appropriately measures the underlying interest, Conclusion Resilient fallback provisions for benchmark rates are essential, How the European economy emerges from the crisis will depend on how we manage this transition, So what I would like to argue today is that policymakers must commit to continue providing certainty to the economy,  A common shock, a common response The coronavirus (COVID-19) is a common shock that has had asymmetric effects[1], hurting some sectors and economies much more than others, For monetary policy, this means providing certainty about financing conditions well into the future,[7]  The PEPP envelope can be further expanded and extended, if warranted by the inflation outlook,5% in 2023 – this means that financing conditions will need to remain very supportive even as growth accelerates from next year onwards,  Investing in Europe’s recovery But firms need certainty about more than just financing conditions, Conclusion The coronavirus shock may be a turning point for Europe, Anderton, R, As a result, EURIBOR is still used extensively in both new and legacy contracts for cash and derivatives products, We will hear more about the current regulatory and supervisory landscape from the European Commission and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) later in the session, The public consultations build on a common theme, namely the use of the ECB’s €STR in the proposed fallback measures, The market stress observed during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has underscored the relevance of this criterion, Discontinuation of EONIA: the urgent need for a rate transition However, despite the apparent qualities of the €STR, progress in adopting it has been rather slow, If the proposed fallback provisions were ever activated, the market would have to rely extensively on the €STR, In order to encourage a more widespread use of the €STR, and not just as a basis for fallback rates, the ECB is considering publishing compounded €STR average rates as well as a compounded index, Users should therefore swiftly replace EONIA and make wider use of the €STR in cash and derivatives markets, In particular, I would like to thank Mr Phutrakul, his predecessors Steven van Rijswijk and Koos Timmermans, and the entire ING team for the unwavering commitment and dedication they have demonstrated in leading the working group, But what has defined this crisis – and set it apart from previous ones – is the policy response at the European level and the recognition that a common shock requires a common response,  This was a step change in European crisis management, And – of relevance to today’s forum – this has implications for business investment, Firms will be able to take full advantage of favourable financing conditions and carry out their investment plans, High efficiency and institutional quality will be key to maximising the benefits of NGEU,[14] This requires enhancing digital skills and infrastructure, in order to be ready to face the digital challenge, It would also reduce one of the differences in structural conditions that has contributed to divergences among European economies, Reducing uncertainty is key to the effectiveness of the policy stimulus, as the responsiveness of firms to any given policy stimulus may be much weaker in periods of high uncertainty, and Van Reenen, J, (2020), “Is the Eurozone disintegrating? Macroeconomic divergence, structural polarisation, trade and fragility”, Cambridge Journal of Economics, Vol, I very much hope that the public health situation will soon allow us to meet again in person, We will provide further information on these efforts in the coming months, European policies – the ECB’s monetary policy and the joint EU fiscal support – have generated a European dividend, Eurosystem staff now project that the euro area economy will contract by more than 2% in the fourth quarter of this year, with GDP falling by 7,4% in 2023; excluding its more volatile components, it is expected to increase to only 1,  Last week, the ECB’s Governing Council did just that, Given our projections – which foresee that even in a mild scenario inflation would rise to only 1,  To lift the economy out of the crisis, governments need to wisely use the fiscal space created by our monetary policy and other key decisions at the European level – in particular joint EU borrowing,[18]  Investment to support the transition to a low-carbon economy will also be a key component of the recovery from the pandemic throughout the euro area  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               [3]  As part of its mission to promote the smooth operation of the payment system, the Eurosystem has two main objectives in the area of retail payments, This wide range of desirable features creates scope for innovative payment solutions, People are forced to use several instruments at the same time, This trend is likely to persist once the pandemic is over, Cash offers a secure and inclusive way of making in-person payments, but it is not well suited for payments in a digital context, such as in e-commerce, Numerous banks are expanding their range of digital services by entering into agreements with fintechs; in some cases, integration is achieved when a bank acquires a fintech firm,  If not properly regulated, big techs may pose considerable risks from an economic and social perspective and they may restrict, rather than expand, consumer choice, As a result, stablecoin users are likely to bear higher credit, market and liquidity risks, and the stablecoins themselves are vulnerable to runs[15], with potentially systemic implications[16], Yesterday the Euro Retail Payments Board, chaired by the ECB, launched a work stream to facilitate this access, A digital euro would support the modernisation of the financial sector and the broader economy, And in making it easier for intermediaries to provide added value and advanced technological features at lower cost, it would give rise to products that could compete with those of the big techs, thereby benefitting end users, This requires central bank money to remain available under all circumstances – in the form of cash, of course, but also potentially as a digital euro, A recent survey identified over 200 new payment solutions, of which more than one-third were provided by start-ups, For a detailed analysis of these solutions, see ECB (2019), “Implications of digitalisation in retail payments for the Eurosystem’s catalyst role”, July, Stablecoins are digital units of value designed to minimise fluctuations in their price against a reference currency or basket of currencies, See Bindseil, U, Alternatively, limits on individual holdings could be achieved by imposing direct quantitative constraints,[1] The universe of retail transactions[2] amounted to 213 billion payments – two million every five minutes – with an estimated total value of €164 trillion, The second is to ensure that transactions remain safe, underpinning confidence in our currency and the functioning of our economy, Currently, none of the existing solutions – cash, cards, credit transfers, direct debits and e-money – meet all the required features at once, In-person transactions[4] are mostly conducted with cash and cards,[5] Remote purchases are dominated by cards and e-payments,[6] And bills are generally paid using direct debits and credit transfers,[7]  The coronavirus (COVID-19) shock has accelerated the trend towards digitalisation, leading to a surge in online transactions and contactless payments in shops,[9] Payment cards, on the other hand, facilitate digital, contactless payments, And the Europe-wide acceptance of cards issued under national card schemes currently relies on agreements with international card schemes, As a result, people mostly use international schemes for cross-border card payments, and the European market for card payments is dominated by non-European schemes, Generally, Europe is increasingly relying on foreign providers, with a high degree of market concentration in some segments, such as card transactions and online payments,  The influx of technology firms Fintech companies have sparked the latest wave of innovation, accelerating the evolution of the payment system, The global tech giants – the so-called big techs – are aiming for a revolution in the payments landscape, and represent a threat to traditional intermediation, They can use these advantages, their financial strength and their global footprint to provide new payment solutions and expand in both domestic and cross-border transactions,  The big techs may also contribute to a rapid take-up, both domestically and across borders, of so-called stablecoins,[21]  We are supporting access to bank accounts by non-bank providers, so that they can expand the range of payment initiation services they offer, We have created a solid basis for instant payments, with commonly agreed rules and powerful infrastructures, including the TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) service, operated by the Eurosystem, Thanks to the measures we have taken in recent months, all euro instant payment providers and infrastructures will have access to TIPS by the end of 2021, It would be designed to be interoperable with private payment solutions and would thus represent the “raw material” that supervised intermediaries could use to offer pan-European, front-end payment solutions, First, we will test the compatibility between a digital euro and existing central bank settlement services (such as TIPS), In particular, big techs and stablecoins could disrupt the European financial system,    The data refer to European citizens aged 18 or over and include point-of-sale, person-to-person and remote transactions, as well as bill payments, Whether they are made at the physical point of sale or online and whether they are made by private individuals, businesses or the public sector, Payments at the physical point of sale and person-to-person payments, As of 2019, cash is used by euro area adults for 73% of in-person transactions in terms of volume and 48% in terms of value, Card payments account for most of the remainder: 24% in terms of volume and 41% in terms of value, Card payments account for approximately half of all remote purchases, and e-payments for approximately one-quarter, in terms of both volume and value, Direct debits account for 41% of bill payments in terms of volume and 37% in terms of value, Credit transfers account for 20% of bill payments in terms of volume and 29% in terms of value, In terms of the total volume of in-person transactions by euro area adults, cash declined from 79% in 2016 to 73% in 2019, In terms of the value of in-person transactions, it fell from 54% to 48%, VISA and Mastercard intermediate two-thirds of EU card payments and, along with PayPal, dominate online payments, Global stablecoins are initiatives which aim to achieve a global footprint, without necessarily relying on existing payment schemes and clearing and settlement arrangements, (2019), “In search for stability in crypto-assets: are stablecoins the solution?”, Occasional Paper Series, No 230, ECB, August, Up to now, oversight activity has been focused on traditional electronic payment solutions such as payment cards, direct debits, credit transfers and e-money, These include payment initiation services, payment integrators, wallets storing data and tokenised payment account numbers, The experimentation will examine the scalability of TIPS (i, The digital transformation is raising the bar for convenience and safety,[10]  We should not let this reliance turn into dependence, It could reduce the resilience of the payment system and weaken the ability of European authorities to exercise controls,[11] Many of them have adopted data-driven business models, where payment services are provided free of charge in exchange for personal data, This would offer them an even stronger base to further expand the range of their financial activities, including lending, as their superior ability to collect and analyse large volumes of data gives them an information advantage,[13] As I have argued previously[14], stablecoins raise concerns with regard to consumer protection and financial stability, Our policy is based on interconnected elements addressing the entire payment value chain,  First, we have enhanced our retail payments strategy, in order to foster competitive and innovative payments with a strong European presence, We are working to make the European e-identity and e-signature frameworks better suited for payments and the financial sector more broadly, And today we are launching a public consultation on the new regulation, which will then become operational by mid-2021,  We are also completing the public consultation on our new framework for electronic payment instruments, schemes and arrangements, the so-called PISA framework, As part of our comprehensive policy, we are working to safeguard the role of sovereign money in the digital era: we want to be ready to introduce a digital euro, if needed, Together, these two types of money would be available to all, offering greater choice and access to simple, costless ways of paying,  A digital euro would need to be carefully designed, in order to enhance privacy in digital payments[26], respect the rules on countering illegal activities and avoid interference with central bank policies, first and foremost monetary policy and financial stability,  Conclusion Let me conclude, The digital transformation is triggering a revolution in the financial sector, which will bring innovation but also risks, We want to create the conditions for a resilient, innovative, diverse and competitive payments landscape that can better serve the evolving needs of European people and businesses, We want to enable people to choose their preferred way of paying without having to compromise on their expectations of fast, secure, inclusive and seamless payments, and Stracca, L, The European Commission’s legislative proposal on crypto-assets (MiCA) is an important step in this regard, Convenience requires payments to be easy to use, fast and widely accepted, while safety requires low risk from an economic, financial and societal perspective, We must ensure that the payment market remains open to competition, including from European suppliers and technology, It could endanger monetary sovereignty if, as a result, private money – the stablecoin – were to largely displace sovereign money as a means of payment,  Monetary sovereignty could also be threatened if foreign central bank digital currencies became widely used in the euro area, with implications for international monetary spillovers, We must nonetheless be alert to possible non-linear developments that could endanger financial stability and monetary and economic sovereignty, As we aim to enhance the efficiency of European payments, we therefore need to be prepared to rethink the nature and the role of sovereign money, The Eurosystem policy response The Eurosystem is implementing a comprehensive policy to ensure that citizens’ payment needs are met, while safeguarding the integrity of the payment system and financial stability,  Our retail payments strategy also builds on the promotion of instant payments, which make funds immediately available to recipients,  Second, we are adapting our regulatory and oversight framework to the fast pace of financial and technological innovation, PISA extends our oversight[23] to digital payment tokens[24], including stablecoins, and to payment arrangements providing functionalities to end users of electronic payment instruments[25], A digital euro would combine the efficiency of a digital payment instrument with the safety of central bank money, To this end, some stablecoin initiatives pledge to hold a reserve of State-issued currencies or other assets against which stablecoin holdings can be redeemed or exchanged, The ECB has already started work on privacy-enhancing techniques in cooperation with the Bank of Japan, The first is to guarantee that people have access to efficient payment solutions that meet their preferences, They can aggravate the risk of personal information being misused for commercial or other purposes, jeopardising privacy and competition, We are actively promoting pan-European initiatives that offer secure, cheap and widely accepted payment solutions,  In particular, a digital euro should be a means of payment, not a form of investment that competes with other financial instruments, And fourth, we will assess the functionalities of hardware devices that could enable offline transactions, guaranteeing privacy, And while they could offer convenient and efficient payment solutions, they also risk endangering competition, privacy, financial stability and even monetary sovereignty, We are promoting safe, pan-European instant payments, In the current situation the viability of such a business model is however challenged by the fact that short term rates are negative, In contrast, the substitutability between central bank money and bank deposits is limited by the fact that, on bank balance sheets, deposits are matched against risky assets (bank loans)  \n",

combination of the already-low levels of our main policy rates and our previously-installed forward guidance on the future path of interest rates (which links the path of our policy rates to the robust convergence of inflation to our aim) has acted as an automatic stabiliser through the adjustment of policy rate expectations – and hence the entire spectrum of monetary conditions – to pandemic-related changes in the inflation outlook,    The cost of monetary policy inaction In assessing the contribution of monetary policy to countering the pandemic shock, a natural benchmark is to calculate the adverse impact that would have materialised had monetary policy not been responsive,3 percentage points lower and the annual inflation rate would be 0, A more realistic assumption for constructing counterfactual financial conditions is to recognise that, in the event of policy inaction, financial markets – which were already highly destabilised – would have gone into a tailspin, sending the economy into a meltdown, However, building on recent advances in the macro-econometrics of estimating the impact of financial tail risks, preliminary results by ECB staff indicate that the ECB’s removal of the financial tail risk associated with the pandemic ensured a degree of support to growth that is several times larger than the impact derived by the more limited calculation shown in Chart 3,[10]   Chart 4 Impact on output of a tightening of credit conditions under different states of the economy  (year-on-year percentage changes)   Source: ECB calculations,[11]   Chart 5

Sources: Standard & Poor’s and ECB staff calculations,     Chart 14 Leverage ratio of firms  (percent, median)   Sources: Standard & Poor’s and ECB staff calculations, In particular, fiscal transfers in normal times are associated with only-limited effects on output, but these constitute a powerful instrument when granted to liquidity-constrained households or struggling firms in the current environment, A tightening in funding costs or worsening liquidity positions have so far been forestalled by the prompt policy reaction, and banks, in turn, have been able and willing to meet the strong demand for liquidity over the course of the pandemic, The October euro area bank lending survey (BLS) reports a broad-based tightening of credit standards that banks attribute primarily to the risks underlying the macroeconomic environment and a deterioration in borrower creditworthiness (Chart 15), The net percentages for the “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in credit standards, currently mainly related to the policy interventions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, The latest observation is for the third quarter of 2020 for actual credit standards and the fourth quarter of 2020 for expected credit standards, Furthermore, this adverse interaction would be reinforced if household spending were to weaken and thereby were to further dampen firm prospects, In this context, it is essential that inflation expectations are anchored by the commitment of the central bank to offset the negative pandemic shock to the inflation path and ensure convergence to the inflation aim over the medium term, In this context, our in-progress strategy review will help to shape the future course of our monetary policy, (2020), “The ECB’s monetary policy in the pandemic: meeting the challenge”, speech at the 62 NABE Annual Meeting, 6 October, (2020), “The ECB’s monetary policy in the pandemic: meeting the challenge”, speech at the 62 NABE Annual Meeting, 6 October See also de Guindos, L, The paper shows how the sharp increase in financing conditions at the outset of the pandemic were assuaged by a QE programme that eased balance sheet constraints on financial intermediaries, which in turn improved overall financial conditions, The study also shows that these crisis policy interventions may have longer lasting effects on the economy, (2019), “Vulnerable growth”, American Economic Review, Vol 109 (4), pp, (2020), “The ECB’s monetary policy in the pandemic: meeting the challenge”, speech at the 62 NABE Annual Meeting, 6 October and Lagarde, C, (2020), “The ECB’s monetary policy in the pandemic: meeting the challenge”, speech at the 62 NABE Annual Meeting, 6 October, Shaded areas report take-up of banks that change their expected use of funds between survey waves, However, the results of the ECB’s pilot Consumer Expectations Survey (CES) confirm that these households are receiving a higher share of pandemic-related government support,[14] This points to the risk that cumulated leverage might weigh on business investment during the post-pandemic recovery phase, However, there are some worrying signals in recent survey data, In one direction, banks may view the dwindling loan demand as a negative signal about the state of the economy,  Third, since it is clear that considerable fiscal support (at both EU and national levels) remains necessary for as long as the pandemic limits the normal operation of the economy and in order to underpin the post-pandemic recovery phase, monetary policy must act both to facilitate the necessarily-expansive fiscal stance and to minimise the crowding-out of private sector activity that would occur if high levels of public borrowing were transmitted to an increase in sovereign yields, Second, it would contribute to a downward drift in inflation expectations that might become entrenched, By setting the monetary stance at the appropriate level to deliver the financial conditions required to offset the pandemic shock to inflation, the underlying inflation trajectory will be restored, This will remain an essential priority even in the post-pandemic phase, given that the macroeconomic hit from the pandemic is likely to persist even after medical solutions have been rolled out, (2020), “Consumption Dynamics in the COVID Crisis: Real Time Insights from French Transaction & Bank Data”, Focus, No 049-2020, Conseil d’analyse économique, p, As shown in Chart 2, these operations have substantially supported the granting of loans to the non-financial private sector, have been effective in easing terms and conditions on bank lending and have helped keep lending rates near historic lows, The blue bar measures the same take-up by banks that intend to use the funds for granting loans, The yellow bar reflects take-up by banks that intend to use the funds for purposes other than substituting market funding or granting loans (government securities, holding as cash, financing other financial entities, and others), The green bar reports the take-up by banks that plan to allocate the funds to more than one purpose,8 percentage points lower by 2022 in cumulative terms (Chart 3), In the type of macroeconomic models that central banks typically use for simulation and policy analysis, it is challenging to reflect the role of monetary policy measures in providing a credible backstop against adverse tail risks – such as an arrest in the flow of credit to the economy and acute financial instability, Chart 6 shows that the impact of the pandemic also varies across countries, in line with differences in the relative importance of the services sector and available policy space,Notes: “Actual” values are changes that have occurred, while “expected” values are changes anticipated by banks,Notes: “Actual” values are changes that have occurred, while “expected” values are changes anticipated by banks, Another type of adverse real-financial feedback loop under pandemic conditions consists of the self-reinforcing nature of a sub-optimal fiscal-financial interaction process by which fiscal policy insufficiently responds to the pandemic shock in fear of triggering an unwarranted tightening of funding conditions, Conclusion The pandemic constitutes a multi-phase challenge for monetary policy, Only by ensuring appropriately-favourable financial conditions will the full economic recovery be assured and, by countering the negative impact of the pandemic on the projected inflation path, will robust convergence to our medium-term inflation aim be copperfastened, This approach reflects the uncertainty about the most appropriate model representation of the monetary transmission, which is particularly acute when the monetary impulse is imparted through unconventional tools such as asset purchase programmes, In the model set-up, these are shown to prevent a fall in the stock of productive capital, An illustrative counterfactual exercise by ECB staff suggests that the TLTRO support in removing tail risk would be in the order of three percentage points of euro area real GDP growth in cumulative terms over 2020-22, Since additional monetary policy measures were clearly necessary to meet the scale and special nature of the pandemic shock, we introduced a comprehensive package of complementary measures that acted along two main dimensions: (i) asset purchases; and (ii) liquidity operations, It follows that this first approach to quantifying the effects of our policies is likely to underestimate by a wide margin their true effect under the macro-financial conditions generated by the extraordinary pandemic shock,    In relation to business investment, firms are likely to postpone or cancel some of their capital expenditure plans against a background of heightened uncertainty about future demand for their products, spare capacity and weakened balance sheets (Chart 12),Note: The latest observation is for the third quarter of 2020    Fiscal policy is in the best position to differentiate and channel economic support to where it is needed most, “Cost of funds and balance sheet constraints” is the unweighted average of “costs related to capital position”, “access to market financing” and “liquidity position”; “risk perceptions” is the unweighted average of “general economic situation and outlook”, “industry or firm-specific situation and outlook/borrower’s creditworthiness” and “risk related to the collateral demanded”; “competition” is the unweighted average of “competition from other banks”, “competition from non-banks” and “competition from market financing”, The net percentages for responses to questions relating to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to increasing demand and the percentage reporting that it contributed to decreasing demand, Adopting such a broad-based modelling approach increases the robustness of the estimates, (2020), “Gauging the Effects of the German COVID-19 Fiscal Stimulus Package”, mimeo; and Pfeiffer, P,

                                                                                                                                                                                                            Inequality is rising, both within and across countries, Predicting the direction and scope of these shifts for monetary policy is inherently difficult, At the ECB, we are doing this as part of our ongoing monetary policy strategy review, But the pandemic is only the latest in a series of adverse disinflationary shocks that have hit advanced economies in recent years,[3] A longer life expectancy can induce people to save more to smooth consumption over a longer period of time, This is all the more important in a currency union as large and diverse as the euro area, where too low area-wide inflation carries substantial risks that parts of the currency area potentially face long periods of falling prices,   Slide 5 Monetary policy most effective in stressed conditions, deposit rates often floored at 0%     But empirical evidence also suggests that the marginal effects of financial conditions on output and inflation become less clear when the economy is recovering or expanding, In the years after the global financial and euro area sovereign debt crises, there has been a broad debate about the appropriate policy response to lift the euro area economy out of its low-growth, low-inflation trap, Empirical evidence suggests that such indicators can often provide only little additional forward-looking information about inflation, even for a horizon of only one to two years ahead,[19] For example, in surveys a significant fraction of consumers report very high inflation expectations – often in excess of 10%, But a limited understanding of actual levels does not necessarily stop people from acting on their beliefs, They would face two pertinent challenges, however, The first is that monetary policy faces constraints, But these instruments will ultimately also face constraints, The wide-ranging nature of the instruments we use today raises the bar of accountability, But side effects are a difficult topic for central banks, no less than for medical practitioners, These concerns raise the question as to whether monetary policy should take financial stability considerations more systematically into account and, if so, how this should be done,  One aspect in this context is the optimal interaction between monetary and prudential policies, (2017), “Conventional Monetary Policy Transmission During Financial Crises: An Empirical Analysis”, Journal of Applied Econometrics, Vol, (2017), “Measuring the natural rate of interest: International trends and determinants”, Journal of International Economics, Vol, (2020), “Communication and the Beliefs of Economic Agents”, NBER Working Papers, No 27800, National Bureau of Economic Research, (2017), “Is monetary policy less effective when interest rates are persistently low?”, BIS Working Papers, No 628, Bank for International Settlements, April,[1] And global value chains are being re-examined, Central banks may have to change how they pursue their mandates in the face of evolving consumer preferences and changing technologies, COVID-19 and risks to price stability Let me explain each of these challenges in turn, starting with the meaning of price stability in times of low inflation, But if prices fall or stagnate for the wrong reasons, as is the case today, then they are typically the harbinger of lower future growth and employment,  The same forces that are weighing on inflation have also contributed to the decline in the real natural rate of interest – the rate that balances savings and investment without exerting pressure on prices (see right chart slide 3),[4] By stabilising market conditions at a time of exceptional uncertainty and demand for safety, the PEPP acted as an important circuit breaker that stopped the pandemic from turning into a full-blown financial crisis (see slide 4),  Heightened uncertainty, in turn, is likely to weaken the willingness and ability of firms and households to take full advantage of historically loose financial conditions, Evidence is too scant to draw definitive conclusions at this stage,  This is why many central bank scholars have been concerned about the gradual fall in market-based inflation expectations in recent years, First, a large part of the fall in market-based inflation expectations can be explained by a fall in the inflation risk premium (see left chart slide 7),  Once one corrects for the fall in the risk premium, developments in market-based and survey-based measures of inflation expectations are much more aligned (see right chart slide 7),   Slide 7 Declining risk premium accounting for large share of fall in inflation expectations     Second, it is not clear how representative option prices in financial markets are for the broader economy,[18]  By now, we have a relatively clear understanding that most households and firms cannot point with any certainty to the actual level of inflation or interest rates, And, second, if people associate higher inflation with worse personal economic outcomes, then we should become better in explaining to the public what it is that we do and why current low inflation may be harmful to growth and employment, But it is much harder to explain why inflation of 2% is better than 1%, But what we learn from our analysis of how monetary policy transmission to the real economy may change in a low interest rate environment may ultimately also affect the way we calibrate and design our policy instruments, as well the horizon over which we want to achieve our inflation aim, Conclusion Let me conclude, 391-415; Bernanke, B, 108, Supplement 1, pp, New business models are being developed, It agreed on this definition after a long period in which too high rather than too low inflation was the main predicament central banks were facing,[27]  Banks may start restricting their lending activities the lower yields are and the flatter the yield curve is, particularly in an environment in which capital buffers may need rebuilding following the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis, While macroprudential policies are the first line of defence against the build-up of financial vulnerabilities, it is widely acknowledged that such policies do not yet offer effective protection, and Van Reenen, J, Van den End, J, For linear estimates of the IS curve, see Holston, K, and Williams, J, Van den End, J, and Schneider, M, New research demonstrates that trust has a tangible impact on households’ inflation expectations,  These questions form important elements of our monetary policy strategy review, (2020), “Unequal scars –
