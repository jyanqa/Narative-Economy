## Abstract

The research aims to analyze the response of yield curves against ECB’s communication from 2018 until May 2021. The analysis is executed for the monthly and daily data. The data published by ECB regarding Euro area government bonds yield of 3-month, 1-year, 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year maturity are aggregated. In addition, all speeches which are official released by ECB are collected as well. By applying natural language processing techniques, text mining and sentimental analysis in particular, the collection of speeches are converted into a monthly time series. After that, in order to observe the yield curves’ reaction to communication of ECB, multiple OLS regression models are alternately executed on both daily and monthly dataset. The result appears that short-term yield curves, particularly 3-month maturity and 1-year maturity, are influenced by ECB’s communication when the model applied on monthly frequency data. Besides, regardless of data frequency, there is no signals indicating the relationship between ECB’s communication and 2-year, 5-year, 10-year maturity yields curves.
